# Welcome to the Zunder Lab!

Starting in January 2016, we will be part of the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.virginia.edu/) in the [School of Medicine](http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/) and [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/).

Research in our laboratory is focused on discovering the mechanisms that control stem cell fate. We study *in vitro* differentiation to gain insight into stem cell behavior during normal development and disease, and we study *in vivo* development to gain insight into the derivation of clinically relevant cell types for regenerative therapy. In order to study the complex mixtures of rapidly changing cell types that exist in these *in vitro* and *in vivo* systems, we are building experimental and computational tools that track cell populations as they change over time using molecular characterization at the single-cell level. Using these tools, our goal is to define the fundamental principles of cellular pluripotency and differentiation.
