# Research in the Zunder lab is focused on discovering the mechanisms that control stem cell fate.

Our research takes advantage of the close parallels between *in vitro* stem cell differentiation and *in vivo* development. Our *in vitro* experiments can provide insight into stem cell behavior during normal development and disease, and our *in vivo* experiments can provide insight into the derivation of clinically relevant cell types for regenerative therapy.

The central aim of our research is to discover the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell behavior. Specifically, we are working to identify factors that control the progression and branch points of stem cell differentiation.

In order to study the complex mixtures of rapidly changing cell types that occur during *in vitro* and *in vivo* differentiation, we use single-cell analysis methods such as mass cytometry, which provides a detailed molecular picture of each cell with a throughput of one million cells per hour.

Each single-cell measurement represents a molecular "snapshot" in time. We seek to stitch these "snapshots" together in order to recreate the molecular history of cellular differentiation. To accomplish this, we are building experimental and computational tools to track cell populations as they change over time. We have found force-directed graph layout algorithms to be useful for this purpose, and are working to incorporate additional factors such as timepoint and cell lineage into this analysis.

By tracing the molecular path of differentiation, we can identify molecular factors that may play a role in differentiation.  We can test these, and identify markers that are important.  This information will be valueable because we can use it to learn about normal and disease development and to improve regenerative transplantation therapy.
